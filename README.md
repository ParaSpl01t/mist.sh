# mist.sh

Bash based SSG for modern blogs.

mist.sh is an improved and feature rich successor of my first SSG experiment [paraSpl01t/smiley.sh](https://github.com/paraspl01t/smiley.sh)

mist.sh aims to provide all basic features to get your blog up and running in no time.

## TO-DO

-   [x] create an empty repository
-   [ ] port old code here removing bad code (basically remove all but a few lines)
-   [ ] write more bad code
